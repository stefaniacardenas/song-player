#Song Player
==================

This is an exercise I started this afternoon to improve my skills with JavaScript, jQuery and Jasmine.js.
It's a song player that allows you to play, pause and skip songs as well as looping them or randomise them. I haven't complete it yet and I will probably come back to this later.


Technologies used
-----------
For the completion of this project I used the following technologies:

* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Jasmine.js
* HTML5
* CSS3
